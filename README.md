# odin-recipes

July 7th 2022 ~9am

This is my first attempt at a funcitoning webpage, following the Odin Project program.
Hopefully by the end of this project I will have a strong grasp on HTML.
I am planning to be job ready by this time next year.

So far I have added a main page and three links to seperate recipe pages.
I've gotten much more comfortable with git (add, commit, and push).
I'm getting the hang of HTML syntax and tags.
VS code is easy to use, i've had some previous experience with this attempting to learn some other languages recently.

Making progress. --- July 7th 2022 ~1pm


Starting in on the CSS page today.  ~11:30am July 7th 2022

Made so decent progress, cleaned up my syles.css, learned a lot about it yesterday.
Starting into "Foundations: Block and Inline" (51% completion) on the odin project.
This might be a bit redundant from all the reading I did already but i'll power 
through it regardless just to be sure it's starting to sink in.
The day is now, July 13th ~10am


Currently at 59% completion, i'm about to start the 5th step in the assignments on
"Foundations: alignment" (flexbox)--- going to take a break.  ~2;15 pm July 13th 2022

Finished excercisses 01-06 on flexbox (odin project) -- ~3pm July 14th 2022

So i've made it to 61% of the Foundations section, working on the landing page.
Made some decent progress, getting a bit stuck need a break.
July 16th ~6:15pm
