This is my first attempt at a funcitoning webpage, following the Odin Project program.
Hopefully by the end of this project I will have a strong grasp on HTML.
I am planning to be job ready by this time next year.

So far I have added a main page and three links to seperate recipe pages.
I've gotten much more comfortable with git (add, commit, and push).
I'm getting the hang of HTML syntax and tags.
VS code is easy to use, i've had some previous experience with this attempting to learn some other languages recently.

Making progress. --- July 7th 2022 ~1pm


Starting in on the CSS page today.  ~11:30am July 7th 2022
